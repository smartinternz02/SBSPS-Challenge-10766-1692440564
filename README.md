Our problem statement was to analyse the top 100 k-dramas of 2023 using IBM Cognos Analytics and extract insights from it.
Our solution involves using IBM Cognos Analytics and Python's Flask framework. 
We downloaded the dataset from Kaggle and imported the csv file into IBM Cognos. 
We performed Data Exploration on our dataset and created Dashboard, Story and Report. 
We used Flask to create a website and embedded the dashboard, story and report into the website.
